# mean-blogger

**Blogging software written on the MEAN stack**
***

## Purpose

Basically, I'm building something similar to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) or [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org) on the **MEAN** stack.

I'm doing this to further my understanding of the **MEAN** technologies, as well as others, and to get the experience of writing a full web app that uses *Test Driven Development* and an *automated build process* (using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)).

## MEAN
**mean-blogger** is built upon the **MEAN** stack:
* [mongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) for the database
* [express](http://expressjs.com) to structure the backend code
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) to build the single-page front end app
* [nodeJS](http://nodejs.org) As the backend platform (the substrate upon which [express](http://expressjs.com) is built)
