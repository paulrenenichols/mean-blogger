<h1 id="animations">Animations</h1>
<p>AngularJS 1.2 provides animation hooks for common directives such as <code>ngRepeat</code>, <code>ngSwitch</code>, and <code>ngView</code>, as well as custom directives
via the <code>$animate</code> service. These animation hooks are set in place to trigger animations during the life cycle of various directives and when
triggered, will attempt to perform a CSS Transition, CSS Keyframe Animation or a JavaScript callback Animation (depending on if an animation is
placed on the given directive). Animations can be placed using vanilla CSS by following the naming conventions set in place by AngularJS
or with JavaScript code when it&#39;s defined as a factory.</p>
<p>Animations are not available unless you include the <a href="api/ngAnimate"><code>ngAnimate</code> module</a> as a dependency within your application.</p>
<p>Below is a quick example of animations being enabled for <code>ngShow</code> and <code>ngHide</code>:</p>
<div class="runnable-example" module="ngAnimate" deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" id="example-example69" outputFolder="examples/example-example69">
  <div class="runnable-example-file" name="index.html" language="html" type="html">
<pre><code class="lang-html">  &lt;div ng-init=&quot;checked=true&quot;&gt;&#10;    &lt;label&gt;&#10;      &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; ng-model=&quot;checked&quot; style=&quot;float:left; margin-right:10px;&quot;&gt; Is Visible...&#10;    &lt;/label&gt;&#10;    &lt;div class=&quot;check-element sample-show-hide&quot; ng-show=&quot;checked&quot; style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&#10;      Visible...&#10;    &lt;/div&gt;&#10;  &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class="runnable-example-file" name="animations.css" language="css" type="css">
<pre><code class="lang-css">  .sample-show-hide {&#10;    padding:10px;&#10;    border:1px solid black;&#10;    background:white;&#10;  }&#10;&#10;  .sample-show-hide.ng-hide-add, .sample-show-hide.ng-hide-remove {&#10;    -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;&#10;    -moz-transition:all linear 0.5s;&#10;    -o-transition:all linear 0.5s;&#10;    transition:all linear 0.5s;&#10;    display:block!important;&#10;  }&#10;&#10;  .sample-show-hide.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active,&#10;  .sample-show-hide.ng-hide-remove {&#10;    opacity:0;&#10;  }&#10;&#10;  .sample-show-hide.ng-hide-add,&#10;  .sample-show-hide.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active {&#10;    opacity:1;&#10;  }</code></pre>
  </div>
<iframe class="runnable-example-frame" src="examples/example-example69/index.html" name="example-example69"></iframe>
</div>



<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>See the <a href="api/ngAnimate">API docs for <code>ngAnimate</code></a> for instructions on installing the module.</p>
<p>You may also want to setup a separate CSS file for defining CSS-based animations.</p>
<h2 id="how-they-work">How they work</h2>
<p>Animations in AngularJS are completely based on CSS classes. As long as you have a CSS class attached to a HTML element within
your website, you can apply animations to it. Lets say for example that we have an HTML template with a repeater in it like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div ng-repeat=&quot;item in items&quot; class=&quot;repeated-item&quot;&gt;
  {{ item.id }}
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the <code>.repeated-item</code> class is present on the element that will be repeated and this class will be
used as a reference within our application&#39;s CSS and/or JavaScript animation code to tell AngularJS to perform an animation.</p>
<p>As ngRepeat does its thing, each time a new item is added into the list, ngRepeat will add
a <code>ng-enter</code> class name to the element that is being added. When removed it will apply a <code>ng-leave</code> class name and when moved around
it will apply a <code>ng-move</code> class name.</p>
<p>Taking a look at the following CSS code, we can see some transition and keyframe animation code set for each of those events that
occur when ngRepeat triggers them:</p>
<p>```css
/<em>
  We&#39;re using CSS transitions for when
  the enter and move events are triggered
  for the element that has the .repeated-item
  class
</em>/
.repeated-item.ng-enter, .repeated-item.ng-move {
  -webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
  -moz-transition:0.5s linear all;
  -o-transition:0.5s linear all;
  transition:0.5s linear all;
  opacity:0;
}</p>
<p>/<em>
 The ng-enter-active and ng-move-active
 are where the transition destination properties
 are set so that the animation knows what to
 animate.
</em>/
.repeated-item.ng-enter.ng-enter-active,
.repeated-item.ng-move.ng-move-active {
  opacity:1;
}</p>
<p>/<em>
  We&#39;re using CSS keyframe animations for when
  the leave event is triggered for the element
  that has the .repeated-item class
</em>/
.repeated-item.ng-leave {
  -webkit-animation:0.5s my_animation;
  -moz-animation:0.5s my_animation;
  -o-animation:0.5s my_animation;
  animation:0.5s my_animation;
}</p>
